# Flutter Clean Architecture With Domain-Driven-Design
___

We will build a **clean & organized** app by following the **Domain-Driven-Design (DDD)** software design approach

We will divide our code into **four layers**:

- Presentation Layer (for widgets,routes,screens,etc...)

- Application Layer (for BLoCs, or any state management solution)

- Domain Layer (for core business logic and contracts)

- Infrastructure Layer (for contract implementation)

This will make our app **"bullet-proof"** and easy to **"unit-test"** and **"maintain"** in the future
